## Coming Up

1. Setting Expectations
2. What is Vim?



## Setting some Expectations

- This discussion will _not_:
    - Cover what `vimtutor` will teach you
    - Magically make you a Vim guru
    - Show even 10% of the power of Vim

- This discussion _will_:
    - Show you some of the coolest features of Vim
    - Teach you enough to teach yourself

>   Most people use only 10% of the functionality of Vim.
>   The 10% only differs from person to person



## What is Vim?

### Vim is...
- A programmer's text editor
- An extremely valuable tool to master

### Vim is NOT
- A replacement for **all** of the tools in your tool box



## Composability

- Most commands are composed of an action and a motion
    - Actions do something
    - Motions move the cursor
- Most editors don't have anything like this!



## Uncommon Motions

- Last point in the change list: `g;` (`g,` to go back)
- Text objects: `w`, `s`, `p`, `b`, `B`, etc.
    - Pneumonic?
        - "a word" -> `aw`
        - "inner block" -> `ib`



## More Uncommon Motions

- Next character:
    - `f<char>` (inclusive)
    - `t<char>` (exclusive)
- `{number}|`: to a certain column
- `gj`, `gk` move up and down over window-wrapped lines
- `(` and `)`: sentences
- `{` and `}`: paragraphs
- More: see `:h motion.txt`



## Antipatterns

- A less efficient way of doing something that becomes a bad habit
    - `ddO` instead of `S`
   - `dbx` instead of `daw`
   - `f<lvt>U` instead of `gUit`
- Be careful not to worry about optimization more than working, though



## Fixing Some Common Annoyances

- Use .vimrc to store preferences
- Turn on the mouse: `set mouse=a`
- Turn on syntax highlighting: `syntax on`
- Set your background color: `set bg=dark`



## Copy and Paste

- Forget Copy and Paste
- Think registers
    - You now have 35 copy buffers
- `"+` is the X server (i.e. system) copy/paste register, copy to here to
    copy out of Vim
- `:reg` - view the contents of registers
- `<C-r>` in insert mode puts the register



## Common registers

- `"[1-9]` history registers
- `"0` the yank register
- `"[a-z]` are named registers
- `"[A-Z]` same as "[a-z] but append



## Important registers

- `"/` current search pattern
- `"-` small delete
- `"=` expression register  
- `"_` the black hole register



## Read-only registers

- `":` last `:` command 
- `".` last inserted text 
- `"%` filename of the current buffer.
- `"#` filename of the alternate file
    - More on that in a minute
- `:h registers`



## Macros

- `.` the short macro operator
    - `.` repeats the last change
- `qa` record a macro in register `a`
- `q` to finish recording
- `@a` execute the macro in register `a`
- Macros are saved as text, so you can edit them manually!



## Multiple Files

- From `:h windows`:
   - A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
   - A window is a viewport on a buffer.
   - A tab page is a collection of windows.
- Use buffers, windows, and tabs 
- `:argdo`, `:bufdo`, `:tabdo`



## Buffers

- Just a window into a file on disk.
- Vim remembers a lot of them.
- `:ls` - check out the buffer list
- `set hidden` - don't unload buffers when they're not being looked at.



## Using Buffers

- `:bn` - Next buffer in the list.
- `:bp` - Previous buffer in the list.
- `:bd` - Unload and delete the buffer from the buffer list
- `<C-^>` - Toggle between this and the "alternate" file (usually the last edited)
- `:b<num>` change to buffer number <num>
- `:b <name>` fuzzy match buffer change (use tab complete!)



## Windows

- Very handy for viewing multiple files at once
- `<C-w>` prefixes most window commands
- `<C-w>v` vertical split
- `<C-w>s` horizontal split
- `<C-w>n` new buffer in a horizontal split window
- `<C-w>c` close the window -- useful for escaping from `:h <anything>`.
- Tons of window commands! Check `:h windows`



## Tabs

- Not quite the tabs you're used to in, say, Gedit
- Useful for holding different sets of windows
- `gt` go to the next tab
- `gT` go to the previous tab
- `:tabnew` create a new tab



## Syntax Completion

- Syntax Completion in insert mode
    - `<C-n>` - Next default completion
    - `<C-p>` - Previous default completion
- Omni-completion `<C-x><C-o>` 
    - C (limited C++)
    - CSS, HTML, XHTML, JS
    - PHP, RUBY



## Programming Completion

- `<C-x><C-f>` File paths
- `<C-x><C-d>` Definition
- `<C-x><C-]>` Tags
- `<C-x><C-i>` Keywords
- `<C-x><C-l>` lines



## Other Completions

- `<C-x><C-t>` Thesaurus
- `<C-x><C-k>` Dictionary
- `<C-x><C-s>` Spelling
- `<C-x><C-v>` Vim commands 



## Digraphs & Special Characters

- Digraphs: insert weird characters like ë, Ω, etc.
  - In insert mode: `<c-k>`, followed by one or two characters
  - Example: `i<c-k>a:` yields ä.
  - Check `:h digraphs` for a list of them all!
- `<c-v>` in insert mode: insert the next character literally
  - Tab key doesn't insert a tab character? `<c-v><tab>`



## Templates

- `0r ~/path/to/template`
- Reads in a template to new files
- Can be blocked on file type using autocmds



## Snippets

- Abbreviations will do simple snippets
- `:ab` create/view abbreviations
- Snipmate and Ultisnips
    - Better snippets support
    - Provide advanced completion features



## Plugins and Plugin Managers

- Vim is extensible via plugins 
- Can be written in `vimscript` (VimL), and other languages 
- Stored in `~/.vim` 
- [`vundle`](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) is a plugin that can manage your plugins 
- Plugin commands can use `<LEADER>` keybind for uniqueness 
   - You might need to set them up in `.vimrc` 
   - `<LEADER>` is `\\` by default, some like space or comma



## Some Useful Plugins

- `scrooloose/NERDTree` - Tree-style file listing sidebar 
- `scrooloose/syntastic` - Check syntax while typing 
- `tpope/vim-fugitive` - Git interaction 
- `tpope/vim-surround` - Change surrounding characters
- `SirVer/ultisnips` - Better snippet system 
- `honza/vim-snippets` - Useful standard snippets 
- Anything by Tim Pope (`tpope`) is going to be useful.



## Navigating large code bases

- Ctags
    - `<C-]>` go to tag under cursor
    - `<C-T>` go back to last place
    - `:tags` show the tag stack
- Cscope
    - More powerful but confined to C/C++
    - Much more intelligent 
    - Can be configured otherwise, but it's hacky



## Using Vim to Test faster

- `:make <make_target>`
- `:set makeprg`
- `:cn` `:cw` `:cp` `]c` `[c`
- `:copen`
- `:shell`



## Other Cool Commands

- `gq<motion>`: hard word wrap a line, paragraph, etc.
- `v` and `V`: visual and linewise visual modes.
    - Check `:h visual-mode`: super useful!
- `:` command line - substitute text, run commands, and more! `:h :`
