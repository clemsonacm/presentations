## Coming Up

1.  Git is a VCS. Huh?
2.  Why on Earth do I care?
3.  How can I _git_ started?
4.  Wrap-up



## Unpleasant People

-   git - (n) An unpleasant or contemptible person.
-   git - (n) Free, Open Source, Fast, Scalable, and Distributed Version Control System
    -   Free as in lunch
    -   Open Source as in Linux
        -   Git was built as a VCS _for_ Linux!
    -   Distributed Version Control System??



## What is DVCS and Why You Should Care

-   Imagine the following...



## What you are probably doing right now

-   Backing up your code?
    -   Create a file
    -   Save several copies (with different names?)
    -   Oops, we overwrote our backup ... it's gone!
-   Trying new things?
    -   Save old code to a new file
    -   Merging good stuff with bad stuff is hard!
    -   Found a bug later on? When did it get here?



## And what about group projects?

-   Emailing versions back and forth
-   `diff` and `patch`
-   What if you screwed up?
    -   How does everyone get the fix?
-   What if a new group member joins?



## A _Version Control System_ handles it all!

-   Store a file to a **repository** (a.k.a. a **repo**)
-   The software tracks the versions
-   Provides tools for...
    -   Finding when bugs were added
    -   Finding who wrote a piece of code
    -   Restoring old versions of code
    -   Merging different versions of the same code (teams, etc.)
    -   And more!
-   New team members checkout/clone the repo
-   Now were *gitting* somewhere!



## Getting Started with git

-   First, `git config --global`:
    -   user.name   "Mr. President"
    -   user.email acm@cs.clemson.edu
    -   core.editor Vim
    -   color.ui True
-   `git init` - creates a new repo in the current folder
-   `git clone <url>` - get your own copy of another repo



## Adding some files

-   `git add files...` - staging new changes and files
-   `git status` - see the current status
-   `git commit` - saves a set of changes and a *commit message*



## A Note on Commits


-   A good commit addresses the following:
	1.	Why is this change necessary?
	2.	How does this address this the issue?
	3.	Big picture what was changed?



## Ok... What just happened?

-   `git log` - See what you did
-   `git diff` - See the actual changes as a *diff*
-   `git blame` - See when a line was last changed
-   `git reflog` - Look through *all* recent commits!



## Oops... Now what??

-   `git checkout --` to reset to last commit
-   `git revert` - to reset to a specific commit
    -   try not to use `git reset`
-   As a last resort `git reset HEAD --hard`



## What is a branch?

-   A branch is a set of related versions
-   Great for
    -   Trying something new 
    -   Building new features 
-   Toss it or Merge it



## What is Master?

-   One Branch to rule them all?
-   Stable, Final, Sharable Product
-   Try not to make changes directly here
    -   at least for team projects
-   **Always** test changes merged into Master



## Because Branches

-   `git branch`
-   `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
-   `git merge MyNewBranch`



## Sharing code

-   GitHub and Bitbucket offer free "hosts" 
    -   Free stuff for `.edu` email addresses!
-   Fairly easy to set up a git "server"
-   `git remote add origin`
-   `git push -u MyNewBranch`
-   `git push` after the first push



## When sharing is not caring

-   Some files should not be shared
    -   May contain sensitive information
        -   API Keys
        -   Passwords
    -   May be machine/developer specific
    -   May be a breach of academic integrity
-   Use a `.gitignore` or `core.excludes` file



## Merge Conflicts

-   `git mergetool`
-   There are also tools to do this better
-   Often fairly painless
-   Don't forget to retest after merges



## Need more power?

-   Some hosts provide wikis and issue trackers
-   Pull Requests are a great code review tool
-   Git provides hooks for automating tasks
-   Create your own commands with git!
-   vim Fugitive
-   `git help`



## But my lovely UI... <span id=emoticon>:(</span>

-   There are tools that use git with GUIs
-   Some of them are quite good
    -   Github has a great desktop client
-   Meld is fantastic, but there are others
    -   Downside is Meld is not on lab machines
    -   gvimdiff and vimdiff for the Vim crowd
    -   For the emacs OS use `emerge`



## Wrap-Up




## Summary

-   Please use version control
-   Git is an easy to use DCVS
-   Spend less time reverting more time coding
