# Abstract: Automation in the Classroom

The purpose of this talk is to introduce how instructors could approach the topic
of using automation in the classroom.  We will make a case for automation both
from a student's and instructor's perspective.  Then we will get into detail about
techniques and tools that can be used for classroom automation.  Finally we will
examine a case study in Automation.  We will examine Dr. Jacob Sorber's work on
the auto-grader that he has developed for his Operating Systems and Network
Programming Courses and explain how it is implemented both technically as well
as part of the classroom environment.
