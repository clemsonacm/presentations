# Abstract: Automation in the Classroom

The purpose of this talk is to introduce how instructors could approach the
topic of using automation in the classroom.  We will make a case for automation
both from a student's and instructor's perspective by showing that automation
can save time, encourage test driven development, and improve testing for
knowledge.  We will also address concerns regarding grading automation including
accuracy, confidentiality, and security.  Then we will get into detail about
techniques and tools that can be used for classroom automation.  Finally we will
examine case studies of how automation has and can be implemented.  We will
examine how this has been done technically as well as part of the classroom
environment by faculty members at the School of Computing.
