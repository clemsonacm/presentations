## An introduction to Automation

Brought to you by Clemson ACM

### Speakers:

Robert Underwood - ACM Vice President



## Coming Up

- Why would you want to automate your work?
- What sorts of things can you automate?
- When is automation and scripting applicable?
- What tools should I use?
- Thinking bigger: a case study
- Common Objections



# Who are we?


## Clemson ACM

- Student Chapter of the ACM
- Professional and social events for students
- Competitive programming team coached by Dr. Dean
- We want to make the School of Computing a better place


## How we can help your students?

- We teach introductory topics like Linux and Git
- We bring in companies in to present technical topics
- We host the programming team and seminar
	- Teaches teamwork
	- Teaches problem solving
- Open to everyone interested



## Why would you want to automate your work?


## Instructor Perspective

- Saves you time grading for large classes
- Encourages students to submit early and often
- Encourages students to use an iterative approach
- Done correctly, reinforces Test Driven Development


## Student Perspective

- Same benefits as Test Driven Development
- Early feedback on how the project is progressing.
- Helps us determine when we have completed the project.
- Avoid missing stupid mistakes



## When is automation and scripting applicable?


## When is it applicable?

- Generating test data
- Grading programming projects
- Many repetitive tasks


## When is it not applicable?

- Where output is
 - difficult to parse
 - non-deterministic



## What Tools Should I Use for Automation?


## hg

Source Control System

- Configure ssh access to avoid passwords
- `hg clone` clone a repository for the first time
- `hg incomming` check for updates without pulling them
- `hg pull -u` update to the latest submission


## Cloning Repositories

	hg clone ssh://handin@handin.cs.clemson.edu/semester_name/course_name 
	pushd course_name
	./update


## time

Time how long it takes a program to execute

```bash
$ time tar -czf foobar file1.c file2.c
0.01s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 4.656 total
```


## timeout

Kill a program after a timeout

- `timeout 10 ./script.sh`


## bats

Unit testing for CLI Applications

- Written in bash
- Ease to write
- Parse-able output
- Lightweight


## Sample Bats file

```bash
@test "Set example code matches Sample Output" {
	run timeout 10 ./set < set.in
	[ "$status" -eq 0 ]
	[ "$output" = "$(cat set.out)" ]
}
```


## Detailed Example

```bash
@test "Tests using edit distance" {
	run timeout 10 ./strings_writer < test.in
	[ "$status" -eq 0 ]
	run editdistance "$output" "$(cat expected.out)"
	[ "$status" -eq 0 ]
	[ "$output" -lt 5 ]
}
```


## Testing a student's work

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TESTS=$PWD
OUTPUT=$PWD/output
pushd assignments/asg_name
for dir in *
do
	if [ -d "$dir" ];then
		mkdir -p $OUTPUT/"$dir"
		pushd $dir
		timeout 10 make > $OUTPUT/$dir/output-make.txt
		timeout 10 $TESTS/test1.bats &> $OUTPUT/$dir/output-1.txt
		timeout 10 $TESTS/test2.bats &> $OUTPUT/$dir/output-2.txt
		popd
	fi
done
```


## Cron

    PATH=/usr/bin
    SHELL=/bin/bash
    MAILTO=acm
    # minute hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek cmd
    0 0 0 * * echo "Monthly task"
    0 16 * * * echo "Daily at 5pm"
    0 11 * * 1 echo "Every Monday at noon"


## Emailing Results

	#!/bin/bash
	mail -s 'Autograder Results' student@clemson.edu < results.txt


## Generating large datasets

	#!/usr/bin/env python3
	import random
	with open("testdata.in","w") as outfile:
		for i in range(100000):
			outfile.write(random.randint(0,100))



## Thinking bigger: a Case Study


## CPSC 3220

- Set of public and private tests
- Autograder run once a day at noon
- Students emailed their results


## Demo


## How does it help students?

- Faster feedback


## How does it help You?

- Saves time in grading
- Students start earlier and do better
- Saves you defensive programming



# Common Objections


## The Costs of Automation

- Certain mess-ups can be *catastrophic*
	- Lost projects
	- Wrong grades
	- Accidental leaks
- Using well designed framework helps
- Writing scripts will take time


## However you'll probably use it again

## A Word on Security

- The risk isn't much higher
	-  Unless you currently carefully audit every line of code
- Tools like systrace, containers, vms can improve security.
- Treat violations as Academic Integrity Issues.



## Wrap-Up


## Summary

- Automation can save time and effort
- Please consider automation
