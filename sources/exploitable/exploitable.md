## Overview

1. What is Ethical Hacking?
2. How do I get setup?
3. How do I get started?
4. Where do I go from here?  



## What is Ethical Hacking ?

> hack (v) - to circumvent security of software

> ethical (adj) - being in accordance with rules and standards


## Guidelines

1. Do no harm
2. Obey laws and regulations
3. Seek explicit written permission


## Consequences

There are serious consequences

- fines
- jail


## So How do you practice?

Set up your own environment



## How do I get setup?

1. Setup `Vagrant` and `Virtualbox`
2. Download the virtual machines
3. Configure the VMs


## Install VirtualBox

- [VirtualBox][] is a free hypervisor
- Set up virtual machines for testing
- Set up complex networks
- [libvirt][] is also a good option

[libvirt]: http://www.libvirt.org
[VirtualBox]: http://www.virtualbox.org


## Set up Vagrant

- [Vagrant][] configures virtual machines
- Designed for development
- Allows for sharing of environments

[Vagrant]: www.vagrantup.com



## How do I get started?

1. Information gathering
2. Finding exploits
3. Exploiting the VM
4. Documentation


## Information Gathering

- What ports are open?
- What services are running?
- What users exist?
- What programs are installed?
- What is there?


## Finding Exploits

- Look for vulnerable versions
- Target weak passwords
- Look for insecure protocols
- CVE databases and metasploit


## Exploiting the VM

- Use tools to exploit exiting problems
- Can you escalate you permissions?


## Documentation

- Documentation, Documentation, Documentation
- Goal is to secure the system
- Document bad practices and fixes
- Look for similar problems in the future



## Where do I go from here?

- Build out your lab
   - More operating systems
   - Applications
   - Network layouts
- Research and learn more



## Summary

1. We defined Ethical Hacking
2. Made a lab with Vagrant and Virtualbox.
3. Covered some best practices
4. Where to go from here
