## Overview

1. Why secure applications?
2. OWASP Top 10 Web Vulnerabilities
	1. What are they, and how bad are they?
	2. How to identify them.
	3. How to mitigate them.



## Why secure applications?

+	According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2005):
	+	67% of businesses experience Cyber crime
	+	Of those 60% experienced more than 1 threat
	+	Less than 1% of crime amounting to 50% of monetary loss
+	And that was before
	+	Target was hacked in 2012 
	+	Home Depot was hacked 2014 
	+	[McAfee][] estimated 24-120B$ total cost in 2013

## How severe is it?

+ Graded in 4 areas
	+ Attack Vectors
	+ Weakness prevalence
	+ Weakness detect-ability
	+ Technical Impacts



## OWASP Top 10

## Web Vulnerabilities


### 1. Injection

Allowing untrusted inputs to command shells

bash
```
echo $1
```

sql
```
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username='" parameter "';"
```


### 2. Broken Session Management

Predictable or unprotected authentication

+	Authentication credentials are weakly or un-encrypted
+	Session credentials are consistent or predictable
+	Sessions don't timeout or expire after logout


### 3. Cross Site Scripting

Unsafe dynamic content

+	Displaying content from un-trusted sources
+	Try to use a whitelist


### 4. Insecure Direct Object Reference

Failing to check permissions on object reference

>	insecurehost.com/?page=/etc/passwd

+	Check permissions prior to access
+	Check permissions after resolving links


### 5. Security Misconfiguration

patch your site and turn off debug output

+ Nuff' said


### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure

Sending sensitive materials in plaintext

+	Don't send secure data in plain text
+	Turn off insecure cryptography
+	Don't allow security downgrading


### 7. Missing Function Level Access Control

Is it possible to bypass access controls

+	Protecting `/admin` but not `/admin/users`
+	Are authentication checks done user-side?


### 8. Cross Site Request Forgery

Stealing valid authentication from another site

+	Use a unique token to authenticate requests


### 9. Known Vulnerable Components

Using a library that has well know problems

+	Relying on an old insecure version
+	Relying on a backend with a backdoor


### 10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

Don't forward to sites based on user input



## Traditional Application Vulnerabilities


### Improper permissions

+	Running an applications as root that don't require it
+	Overly wide permissions on files
+	Setuid and Setgid


### Buffer Overflow 

```
char password[8];
int login;
scanf("%s",&password");
```

+	Allowing writes past the end of buffers


### Injection

```
sprintf(cmd, "ls %s", directory)
system(cmd);
```
+	Be sure to also check databases and systems


### Attack Vectors

+	Avoid unnecessary dependencies
+	Avoid scope creep in projects


### Heap Exploits

+	Use after free
+	Double free
+	Memory leaks


### Resource Bombs

```
while(1) {fork(); malloc(1000);
```

+	Fork Bomb
+	Exponential expansion
+	Exponential run time expansion
