## Overview

1. Why secure applications?
2. OWASP Top 10 Web Vulnerabilities
	1. What are they and how bad are they?
	2. How to identify them.
	3. How to mitigate them.



## Why secure applications

note:
Insert epic fail examples slides here.

## How sever is it?

+ Graded in 4 areas
	+ Attack Vectors
	+ Weakness prevalence
	+ Weakness detect-ability
	+ Technical Impacts



## OWASP Top 10



### 1. Injection

Allowing untrusted inputs to command shells

bash
```
echo $1
```

sql
```
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username='" parameter "';"
```



### 2. Broken Session Management

Predictable or unprotected authentication

+	Authentication credentials are not or weakly encrypted
+	Session credentials are consistent or predictable
+	Sessions don't timeout or expire after logout



### 3. Cross Site Scripting

Unsafe dynamic content

+	Verify that stored inputs are safe
+	Try to use a whitelist



### 4. Insecure Direct Object Reference

Failing to check premissions on object reference

+	Check permissions prior to access
+	Check permissions after resolving links



### 5. Security Misconfiguration

patch your Stuff and turn off debug output

+ Nuff' said



### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure

Sending sensitive materials in plaintext

+	Don't send in plain text
+	Turn off poor crypto
+	Don't allow security downgrading



### 7. Missing Function Level Access Control

Is it possible to bypass access controls

+	Protect `/admin` but not `/admin/users`
+	Are authentication checks done user-side?



### 8. Cross Site Request Forgery

Stealing valid authentication from another site

+	Use a unique token to authenticate requests



### 9. Known Vulnerable Components

Using a library that has well know problems

+	Relying on an old insecure version
+	Relying on a backend with a backdoor



### 10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

Don't forward to sites based on user input
