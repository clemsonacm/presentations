# What's up with Linux?


## Linux: A Short History

- Created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**
- Written in C and Assembly
- Uses a *Unix-like* file structure (more on that later)
- Kernel is still being maintained by Torvalds & open source
    contributors
- You could contribute if you wanted!


## What's a Distribution?

- A "flavor" of Linux with small differences from the others
- **All** have many similarities
- Might differ in...
    - *Desktop Environment*, the set of programs that handle... the
        desktop
        - Examples are **Gnome** and **KDE**
    - *Package manager*
    - Default *applications*
    - Behind-the-scenes *settings*


## Common Distributions

- Some common distributions are Ubuntu (and children Xubuntu,
    Kubuntu), Fedora, Debian, and Arch Linux (not for the faint of
    heart) -- you configure *everything*


## Big Names in \*nix

- **Linus Torvalds** - creator of Linux, *extremely passionate*.
- GNU Project - "GNU's Not Unix", connected to open source software
    licensing (like the GNU Public License, or GPL)
- Greg Kroah-Hartman: Linux Kernel maintainer and all around awesome
    dude.


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Kernel** is the part of Linux that interacts with your PC's
    hardware.
- **Shell** refers to the program that handles your terminal
    environment with things like the *prompt* and coloring.
- **Bash** is the default shell.


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Grub** is a common Linux *boot manager* that remembers how to get
    from turning your computer on into the OS.
- **PATH** is an *environment variable* that remembers where to look
    for executables when you type one in the terminal


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Version control systems** like **Git**, **SVN**, and **Mercurial**
    allow you to easily implement histories of a project. Linux uses
    Git!
    - Web handin uses Mercurial as a backend and provides a tutorial
        for connecting to Handin on your machine
- **`make` and `Makefile`s** are a *build system* that allow you to
    define rules for running multiple commands at once. Very useful for
    compiling code.


## "Building from Source"

- When you can't get a pre-compiled executable
- Download the source code and run...
- `./configure`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`
- Didn't work? Read README


## Packaging systems

- Easy way to install many applications pre-configured for your OS
- Different distributions have their own **Package Managers**
    - All package managers need to be run using `sudo`
    - `apt-get` - used on Debian based system, including Ubuntu.
        - `apt-get update` - update metadata
        - `apt-cache search <package>` - find package
        - `apt-get install <package>` - install package
        - `apt-get dist-upgrade` - update all packages


## Other Packaging systems

- `dnf` - used on Red Hat based system, including Fedora
- `pacman` - used on Arch Linux
- `rpm` - Legacy back end that is compatible with yum



# The Linux File System


## Basic Hierarchy

- Based on *one* root directory, not drives like C: or D:
- Physical devices (drives, output) and important folders are
    *mounted* to subdirectories of `/`
    - `/home` - where user's files normally live
    - `/dev` - device nodes. Don't mess with things here.
    - `/mnt` - where you can mount things like USB drives.
    - `/usr` - where system libraries and the like are.
    - `/bin` - stores system executables

    **Some distros are a little different in how they manage these folders.**


## Everything is a File

- Linux sees every object as a subclass of a file.
- Folders, links, output devices, executables are all "files"!


## Where are my .exes?

- File extensions categorize, not restrict
- A file with any name could be executed
    - `a.out`, `prog1`, `.bashrc`
- Files starting with a dot like `.bashrc` are usually *hidden* from
    listings
- Running a command like `sl` is really just running an executable
    file within the PATH



# Terminal Power


## echo "navigation commands"

- Stuck? `Ctrl+c` force quits the running program.
- `pwd` lists your current directory
- `cd directory` moves the terminal to `directory`
- `ls` lists files and folders in the current directory
    - `ls -l` gives additional file information
    - `ls -a` shows even `.hidden-files`


## echo "file commands"

### THERE IS NO TRASHCAN. DELETION IS PERMANENT.

- `mv orig.file new.file` moves `orig.file` to `new.file`
    - Use this for moving and **renaming**!
- `cp orig.file clone.file` copies `orig.file` to `clone.file`
- `rm file` removes a file
    - `rm -r directory` deletes a directory


## --Flags?! : Command Structure

- Generally
    `command -one-letter-flag --longer-flag parameter`
    `[optional parameter] parameter-list...`
- Some flags need their own value arguments after them
    - `ping -c 12` OR `ping --count=12`


## Common Flags

- Structure varies by program: try `progname --help` or `-h` 
    - Sometimes simpler than `man progname`
- Many commands use `--verbose` or `-v` to print *more* useful
    information. Verbosity is good!


## Terminal Symbols & Shorthand

- `.` (one dot) is the *current directory*
- `..` (two dots) is the *parent directory*
- `/` is the *root directory*
- `~` is your *user directory*
- `!!` is the *previously entered command*
    - Use `sudo !!` to run the last command under sudo


## Terminal Symbols & Shorthand

- `\` begins an escape character sequence
    - `\n` is a newline character
    - `\` (space) inserts a space into one argument (otherwise the
        argument will break)
    - `\\` actually inserts a backslash
    - `$(command)` or `command` inserts the output of `command` into
    - `command&` will run `command` in the background


## Messing with Output

- Any text output you see in the terminal comes from **standard out**
    (the same stream as **cout** in C++ and **printf()** in C)
    - `echo input` - print `input` to standard out
    - `cat input.file` - print contents of `file` to the terminal


## Messing with Output

- Many commands like `grep` and `less` read from **standard in**
    (**cin** in C++, what **scanf()** reads from in C) if no other args
    are specified
    - `grep pattern input.file` prints lines from `input.file` that
        match/contain the search pattern (could be as simple as one
        word)
    - `less input.file` allows you to read up and down through a large
        chunk of data


## Piping and Redirection

- **Piping** with `command-a | command-b` connects the *standard
    output* of `command-a` to *standard input* of `command-b`, for
    chaining commands
    - `command-a | less` pipes `command-a`'s output into less for easy
        reading
- **Redirection** handles using file contents for standard in / out
- `progname > output.file` overwrites `output.file` with `progname`'s
    output


## Redirection

- `>>` *appends to* `output.file` with `progname`'s output
- `&>` overwrites `output.file` with `progname`'s *error output*
- `&>>` *appends to* `output.file` with `progname`'s *error
    output*
- `progname < input.file` uses `input.file`'s content as input for
    `progname`


## Shell History

### "How did I run that again?"

- Press the up key to cycle through your previously entered commands
- `history` - print previous commands
- Try it with grep -- `history | grep ls`
- `ctrl-r` for a history search


## Shell configuration

- On your home machine, you could replace **bash** with another shell
    like **zsh** or **ksh**
- Editing `~/.bashrc` can customize your shell with functions,
    **aliases**, and **functions**.
- Aliases are simple: `alias sl=echo "Steam Locomotive"`
- There are a ton of tutorials on customizing the shell, so we'll skip
    it for now.


## `man` and Other Awesome Commands

- `man` - summons an *extensive* manual page for about anything
    - `man stdio.h`, `man grep`, `man man`
- `sl` summons a steam locomotive!
- `touch name.file` creates an empty `name.file` if none exists
- `vim [edit.file]` awesome text editor with steep learning curve
- `nano [edit.file]` opens a simple editor
- `curl -O [URL]` copies a file from the web


## `man` and Other Awesome Commands

- `tar` - manage tarball (.tar) and tarball + gzipped (.tgz, .tar.gz)
    archives
    - `tar -xzf` (e**x**tract **z**e **f**iles!!) `<archive>`
        - `tar -xf` for just `.tar`
    - `tar -czf` (**c**reate **z**e **f**iles!!)
        `archivename.tgz files...` to create an archive

## Shell Scripts

- put commands into a file to run them all at once repeatidly
- add `#!/bin/bash` as the first line
- one command per line
- `chmod u+x script.sh`
- `./script.sh`



# Getting Owned by Permissions


## Users, Root and Groups

- *Users* are unique accounts
- *Root* is the **superuser** and can do *anything*.
    - **DON'T TRY TO USE ROOT ON THE CU MACHINES**.
    - Run one command as root with `sudo <command>` and temporarily
        login with `sudo su`


## Users, Root and Groups

- Users in the same *Groups* share permissions pertaining to that
    group
    - E.g. users in `sudoers` can use `sudo` (the admin group might be
        different on other distros)
    - Users can be in multiple groups
- `man chmod` and `man chgrp` for more info on permissions and groups



# Working from other machines


## Getting to your files with SSH

- `ssh username@access.cs.clemson.edu` starts a remote connection to
    the Lab computer
- Pick one of the servers listed in the message and `ssh` to it
- **DON'T RUN/COMPILE ON access.cs.clemson.edu**


## Using a VM

- VirtualBox
    - Can run a Linux VM inside of Windows/Mac OS X


## Windows: Cygwin?

### **Bad Idea.**




# Wrap-up


## Final warnings

### NEVER RUN A RANDOM COMMAND FROM THE INTERNET

- **DON'T CHEAT**
    - Professors use advanced software that checks the algorithms your
        code uses
    - Changing variable names won't help
- Don't use `sudo` on the lab machines
    - They yell at you and phone home to the sysadmins
- Want to install something? Email `ithelp@clmeson.edu` and put
    `School of Computing` in the subject line.


## The snapshot system

- Contents are in `~/.snapshot`
- Keeps hourly, nightly, and weekly backups of files in `~`
- Especially useful when you accidentally overwrite a project at 2 am

### SNAPSHOTS ARE UNIQUE TO CLEMSON. DON'T RELY ON IT!
