# What's up with Linux?


## Linux: A Short History

- Created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**
- Written in C and Assembly Languages
- Uses a *Unix-like* file structure (more on that later)
- Kernel is still being maintained by Torvalds et al
	- You could contribute if you wanted!


## What's a Distribution?

- A "flavor" of Linux with small differences
- Might differ in...
    - *Desktop Environment* - controls windows
        - Examples are **Mate**, **Gnome**, and **KDE**
    - *Package manager*  - install and update software
    - Behind-the-scenes *applications* and *settings*
    - Default *applications* 


## Common Distributions

- **Debian based**: uses the DEB package system
	- Ubuntu (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Mate)
	- Elementary OS, Linux Mint, et al
- **RedHat based**: uses the RPM package system
	- Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux


## Common Distributions
- **OpenSUSE**: heavy focus on OS innovation
- **Source based**: focus on customization
	- Gentoo, ArchLinux


## Big Names in \*nix

- **Linus Torvalds**:  creator of Linux,
- **Greg Kroah-Hartman**: stable branch maintainer
- **Richard Stallman**: founder of GNU
- **GNU Project**: "GNU's Not Unix", 
	- leader in Open Source Software Licensing
	- Wrote GNU Public License (GPL)


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Kernel**: part of Linux that interacts with hardware
- **Shell**: terminal-based control application
	- manipulate anything on the system 
	- starts programs
- **Bash**: is the most common shell


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Environment Variables**: variable that controls program behavior
- **PATH**: where to the shell searches for executables
- **EDITOR**: what editor to use when needed
- **HOME** where your files are kept


## "Kernel" and Other Scary Words

- **Version control systems**: track history of code
	- Common VCSs include `git`, `mercurial`, and `svn`
    - Web handin uses `mercurial` as a back end 
	- See our seminars on `git` or projects for more
- `make` and `Makefile`: a tool for installing software


## "Building from Source"

- When you can't get a pre-compiled executable
- Download the source code
- Read the README file, then often run
- `./configure`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`


## Packaging systems

- Easy way to install many applications
- Most distributions have **Package Managers**
    - package managers need to be run using `sudo`


## APT

- `apt` - used on Debian based systems, including Ubuntu.
	- `apt update` - update metadata
	- `apt search <package>` - find package
	- `apt install <package>` - install package
	- `apt upgrade` - update all packages


## Other Packaging systems

- `dnf`: installed on Fedora
- `rpm`: backend for yum, dnf, et al
- `pacman`: used on Arch Linux



# The Linux File System


## Basic Hierarchy

- Based on *one* root directory, not drives like C: or D:
- Physical devices (drives, output) and important folders are
    *mounted* to subdirectories of `/`

**Some distros are a little different in how they manage these folders**


## Basic Hierarchy

- `/home`: where user's files normally live
- `/bin`: stores system executables
- `/usr`: where system libraries and the like are
- `/dev`: device nodes; Don't mess with things here
- `/mnt`: where you can mount things like USB drives


## Everything is a File

- Linux sees every object as a subclass of a file
- Folders, links, devices, and executables are "files"!


## Where are my .exes?

- File extensions categorize, not restrict
- A file with any name could be executed
    - `a.out`, `prog1`, `.bashrc`
- Files starting with a dot like `.bashrc` are usually *hidden* from
    listings
- Running a command like `sl` is really just running an executable
    file within the `PATH`



# Terminal Power


## echo "navigation commands"

- Stuck? `Ctrl+c` often quits the running program
- `pwd` lists your current directory
- `cd directory` moves the terminal to `directory`
- `ls` lists files and folders in the current directory
    - `ls -l` gives additional file information
    - `ls -a` shows even `.hidden-files`


## echo "file commands"

*** THERE IS NO TRASH CAN! ***

```bash
mv orig.file new.file  # move a file
cp orig.file copy.file # copy a file
rm orig.file           # remove a file
rm -r directory        # remove a directory and contents
```


## --Flags?! : Command Structure

- Generally
    `progname -one-letter-flags --longer-flag parameter`
    `[optional parameters]  parameter-list...`
- Some flags need arguments after them
    - `ping -c 12` OR `ping --count=12`


## Common Flags

- Structure varies by program 
- for help try: `progname --help` or `-h` 
    - Sometimes simpler than `man progname`
- for output try: `progname --verbose` or `-v` 


## Terminal Symbols & Shorthand

- `.` (one dot) is the *current directory*
- `..` (two dots) is the *parent directory*
- `/` is the *root directory*
- `~` is your *user directory*
- `!!` is the *previously entered command*
    - Use `sudo !!` to run the last command under sudo


## Terminal Symbols & Shorthand

- `\` begins an escape character sequence
    - `\n` is a newline character
    - `\` (space) inserts a space into one argument (otherwise the
        argument will break)
    - `\\` actually inserts a backslash


## Terminal Symbols & Shorthand

- `$(command)` or \`command\` inserts the output of `command` into
- `command &` will run `command` in the background


## Messing with Output

- Any text output you see in the terminal comes from **standard out**
	- Think **cout** in C++ and **printf()** in C
- `echo input` - print `input` to standard out
- `cat input.file` - print `file` to the terminal


## Messing with Output

- Many commands like `grep` and `less` read from **standard in**
    - Think **cin** in C++ and  **scanf()** reads from in C
- `grep pattern input.file`: filters a pattern
- `less input.file`: buffers output


## Piping and Redirection

- **Piping** `command-a | command-b` 
	- connects the *standard output* of `command-a` 
	- to *standard input* of `command-b`
	- useful for chaining commands
    - Ex: `command-a | less` easy reading


## Redirection

- **Redirection** reassign standard in/out/error to files
- `progname > output.file` overwrites `output.file` with output
- `>>` *appends to* `file` with `progname`'s output
- `&>` overwrites `file` with `progname`'s *error output*
- `&>>` *appends to* `file` with `progname`'s *error output*
- `progname < input.file` uses `input.file`'s content as input for
    `progname`


## Shell History

*** How did I run that again? ***

- Press the up key to cycle through your previously entered commands
- `history` - print previous commands
- Search it with grep -- `history | grep ls`
- `Ctrl-r` for a history search


## Shell configuration

- On your home machine, you could replace **bash** with another shell
    like **zsh** or **ksh**
- Editing `~/.bashrc` can customize your shell with functions,
    **aliases**, and **functions**.
- Aliases are simple: `alias sl=echo "Steam Locomotive"`
- There are a ton of tutorials on customizing the shell, so we'll skip
    it for now.


## `man` and Other Awesome Commands

- `man` - summons an *extensive* manual page for about anything
    - `man stdio.h`, `man grep`, `man man`
- `touch name.file` creates an empty `name.file` if none exists
- `find` locate a file on your computer


## `man` and Other Awesome Commands

- `vim [edit.file]` awesome text editor with steep learning curve
- `emacs -nw [edit.file]` great OS needing a good editor
- `curl -LO [URL]` copies a file from the web


## `man` and Other Awesome Commands

- `tar` - manage tar ball (.tar) and tar ball + gzipped (.tgz, .tar.gz)
    archives
    - `tar -xzf` (e**x**tract **z**e **f**iles!!) `<archive>`
        - `tar -xf` for just `.tar`
    - `tar -czf` (**c**reate **z**e **f**iles!!)
        `archivename.tgz files...` to create an archive
    - [Relevant XKCD comic](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png)


## Shell Scripts

- put commands into a file to run them all at once repeatedly
- add `#!/bin/bash` as the first line
- one command per line
- `chmod u+x script.sh`
- `./script.sh`



# Getting Owned by Permissions


## Users, Root and Groups

- *Users* are unique accounts
- *Root* is the **superuser** and can do *anything*.
    - **DON'T TRY TO USE ROOT ON THE CU MACHINES**.
    - Run a command as root with `sudo <command>` 
	- temporarily login as root with `sudo --login`


## Users, Root and Groups

- Users in the same *Groups* share permissions pertaining to that
    group
    - Ex:users in `sudoers` can use `sudo` 
	- the admin group might be different
    - Users can be in multiple groups
- `man chmod` and `man chgrp` for more info on permissions and groups



# Working from other machines


## Getting to your files with SSH

- `ssh username@access.cs.clemson.edu` starts a remote connection to
    the Lab computer
- Pick one of the servers listed in the message and `ssh` to it
- **DON'T RUN/COMPILE ON access.cs.clemson.edu**


## Using a VM

- VirtualBox
    - Can run a Linux VM inside of Windows/Mac OS X


## Windows: Cygwin?

*** Bad Idea ***


## Ubuntu for Windows?

*** Better Idea ***


## Dual-boot or VM

*** Best Idea ***



## Final warnings

*** NEVER RUN A RANDOM COMMAND FROM THE INTERNET ***

- **DON'T CHEAT**
    - Professors use advanced software that checks the algorithms your
        code uses
    - Changing variable names won't help
- Don't use `sudo` on the lab machines
    - They yell at you and phone home to the sysadmins
- Want to install something? Email `ithelp@clmeson.edu` and put
    `School of Computing` in the subject line.


## The snapshot system

- Contents are in `~/.snapshot`
- Keeps hourly, nightly, and weekly backups of files in `~`
- Especially useful when you accidentally overwrite a project at 2 am

*** SNAPSHOTS ARE UNIQUE TO CLEMSON. DON'T RELY ON IT! ***
