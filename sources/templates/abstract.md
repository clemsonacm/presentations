# C++ Templates
## Staring into the abyss

### Abstract

C++ templates are one of the most powerful, and probably least understood aspects of C++ programming.  Trying to understand error messages from templates code can feel like staring into the abyss.  In this talk, I introduce many of the various features and dive into applications of C++ templates that are used in the wild.  I will cover several of the common pitfalls and design patterns that result of this feature of C++.  As well as why and how to decipher those error messages.  Please join me Friday April 7 in McAdams 230, at 9am to learn more about how to effectively use C++ templates.
